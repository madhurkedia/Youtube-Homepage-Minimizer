# YouTube Homepage Minimizer

A distraction-free Chrome extension that removes YouTube’s busy homepage and replaces it with a clean, centered search box.

## Why I Built This
YouTube’s homepage is designed to keep you hooked with endless recommendations, trending videos, and shorts.  
While great for entertainment, it often leads to wasted time and lost focus.  

**YouTube Homepage Minimizer** solves this by removing all that clutter and showing only a minimal search box — so you stay intentional and focused.
